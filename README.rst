   :target: https://travis-ci.org/johannesjh/smart_importer


Installation
------------

.. code:: bash

    pip install smart_importer

    # or, to install from local git clone:
    pip install --editable .



Current Functionality
---------------------

When writing a beancount importer, users can apply decorators to their
importerâ€™s ``extract`` function in order to benefit from predictions and
suggestions provided by machine learning.

For example:

.. code:: python

    class MyImporter(ImporterProtocol):
            @PredictPostings(training_data="trainingdata.beancount")
            @PredictPayees(training_data="trainingdata.beancount")
            def extract(file):
              # do the import, e.g., from a csv file
